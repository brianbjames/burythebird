	      <p class="list-group-item-text">There’s no sign of the family that lived here, no stray ball in the lawn or oil stain on the driveway. The house looks like it’s never been lived in, like it’s always been alone.</p>

	      <p class="list-group-item-text">This is the sign for the FBI agent to come out of the kitchen dressed as a waiter. He’s carrying a tray with one of those dome-like lids on the top? And he sets the tray down on the table and lifts the dome-lid and underneath it is his gun and some garnish. Of course, this will all be shot in slow motion.</p>

	      <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">"Say Hello, Gene" in <i>Coe Review</i>, 2005</h4>
	      <p class="list-group-item-text">She wants some chocolate, that gorgeous mom, and a few pudding filled, a couple jelly and a bear claw. I stack them up in the box, nice and neat, even sliding in a few extra donut holes for the baby, and try my damndest not to stare at that beautiful mother’s bra.</p>
