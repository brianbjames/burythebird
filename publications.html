	      <h4 class="list-group-item-heading">"A Great Nation" (forthcoming) in <i>Literary Orphans</i>, 2016</h4>
	      <p class="list-group-item-text">I can hear the protesters chanting outside our walls, over a quarter-mile of ocean. It was a dramatic political maneuver, transplanting the Capitol from the forested heart of our river country to its very fringe, beyond. It sent a message—we will leave you all behind, you provokers and usurpers, we will let you rot, watching from our manmade island, built on dredged up seafloor silt and the toil of thousands, connected to the mainland by a single span of bridge.</p>

	      <p class="list-group-item-text">Alan began to see the actress’s face everywhere. There were posters up in cafes and framed photographs in restaurants, even T-shirts—a man wearing her likeness passed them on the street! Alan held tightly to Phyllis’s hand as if at any moment she could be gone, plastered on a wall, smothered behind a frame.</p>

	      <p class="list-group-item-text">Dee is the oldest, our de facto leader, utterly totalitarian. I taught her that word, but she taught me all sorts of things I didn’t learn in college, like when to pick a fight and how to call a goat.</p>

	      <p class="list-group-item-text">There’s no sign of the family that lived here, no stray ball in the lawn or oil stain on the driveway. The house looks like it’s never been lived in, like it’s always been alone.</p>

	      <p class="list-group-item-text">In the morning, I’d hobbled to the hotel barefoot, draping my sweatshirt over my head like a veil. A man zoomed past me on a golf cart, singing under his breath, I’m too sexy for my body, too sexy for my body—and I’d been certain it was the end of something, the story already spinning in my head.</p>

	      <p class="list-group-item-text">Sometimes Alma wondered if she did have the power. She always knew, for example, when the Dickhead would come. She could feel it, his sloppy drunkenness and desire seeping into their apartment long before the 2am text.</p>

	      <p class="list-group-item-text">She shakes with the storm inside, the water rising. It nearly comes out of her and takes us all, but she stops it, hand to mouth, a floodgate made of fingers. She spits a bit of it into a tissue and stuffs it in the pocket of her nightgown.</p>

	      <p class="list-group-item-text">This is the sign for the FBI agent to come out of the kitchen dressed as a waiter. He’s carrying a tray with one of those dome-like lids on the top? And he sets the tray down on the table and lifts the dome-lid and underneath it is his gun and some garnish. Of course, this will all be shot in slow motion.</p>

	      <p class="list-group-item-text">Huddled around the pool was a crowd of pale and pink Scandinavians. Tricia waved to the Olsons as they clung to a raft, kicking their way across the pool. They were old friends, from when her parents were still married. But the rest were new and young and strangely comfortable dancing around the kidney-shaped pool.</p>
