	      <p class="list-group-item-text">WITH US GIANTS is an upmarket science fiction novel set in a near-future world where the dead can be uploaded to machines and kept in service by the living.
</br>
</br>
In a San Francisco tower, 16-year-old Lilac tells the story of her murder to the home-schooled child to whom she’s been leased. Lilac is a companion, the uploaded dead, marketed as a safe form of contact under quarantine. In the wake of a lethal virus, people can’t go out, but the dead can come in, and they come in all forms, from sad rolling cans to skin jobs that can pass for human.
</br>
</br>
There are plenty of dead, plenty of willing, even if that means being intellectual property. The companionship program creates a new class of people, a product-class without legal rights or true free will, given their command-driven programming. But when Lilac realizes she’s able to defy commands, she escapes her tower and heads north to find her murderer, now an old woman.
</br>
</br>
WITH US GIANTS travels from San Francisco to Siberia, Beverly Hills to Humboldt County, Daly City to the Falklands Islands. While the novel trails Lilac’s journey, each chapter is told from a different point of view, some human, some companion, all of which explore the complex shapes love takes when the dead linger in machine form. </p>

	      <p class="list-group-item-text">After her third diagnosis of cancer, 23-year-old Viv leaves her crappy town in the Nevada desert, downwind from an old atomic bomb testing site, and heads to Los Angeles to participate in the first human trials of a “sleep treatment” that just might save her life, or take what’s left of it.  But before she goes, she does something uncharacteristically risky, stealing from Tail, just 21 and already the biggest criminal in the county, the ruler of their poisoned town. Stealing from him—it’s like being alive. But she hasn’t thought it through, what it might do to her town while she’s sleeping—how could she? 
</br>
</br>
TO PROMISED LANDS explores a single choice from three points of view, alternating between Viv’s version of things, and that of the people she leaves behind, over a backdrop of the slow-moving political circus of 2005.
